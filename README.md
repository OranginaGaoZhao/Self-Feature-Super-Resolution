# Self-Feature-Super-Resolution

## IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION USING CNN OPTIMISED BY SELF-FEATURE LOSS

### Pre-trained model and testing codes (PyTorch)

## Overview:

This script generates 3x super resolved images based on the test images in the folder "test_images/".
The model is trained from the project of the "Image Super-Resolution Using CNN with Self-Feature Loss".
